<h3>Neural Network Pruning<a class="headerlink" href="#neural-network-pruning" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Neural network pruning is a promising model compression technique that removes the least important parameters/neurons in the network and achieves compact architectures of minimal accuracy drop and maximal inference acceleration. As state-of-the-art model sizes have grown at an unprecedented speed, pruning has become increasingly crucial to reducing the computational and memory footprint that huge neural networks require.</p>

<section id="pruning-patterns">
<h3>Pruning Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#pruning-patterns" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Pruning patterns defines the rules of pruned weights’ arrangements in space. Intel Neural Compressor currently supports <strong>N:M</strong> and <strong>NxM</strong> patterns. N:M pattern is applied to input channels; for NxM pattern, N stands for output channels and M stands for input ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NxM Pruning</p>
<p>NxM pruning means pruning parameters in groups and deleting entire blocks, filters, or channels according to some pruning criteria. Consecutive NxM matrix blocks are used as the minimum unit for weight pruning, thus NxM pruning leads to lower accuracy due to restrictive structure compared to unstructured pruning but it can significantly accelerate the model execution as it fits better with hardware designs.  <em>Users could set “NxM”, e.g. “4x1”, in pruning pattern to enable it.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>N:M Pruning</p>
<p>N weights are selected for pruning from each M consecutive weights, The 2:4 pattern is commonly used. <em>Users could set  “N:M” , e.g. “2:4”, to enable it.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Channel-wise Pruning</p>
<p>Channel-wise pruning means removing less salient channels on feature maps and it could directly shrink feature map widths. <em>Users could set “channelx1”( some input channels will be totally pruned) (or “1xchannel”)  to enable it.</em></p>
<p>An advantage of channel pruning is that in some particular structure(feed forward parts in Transformers etc.), pruned channels can be removed permanently from original weights without influencing other dense channels. Via this process, we can decrease these weights’ size and obtain direct improvements of inference speed, without using hardware related optimization tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers">Intel Extension for Transformers</a>.</p>
<p>We name this process as <span id="click"><strong>Model Auto Slim</strong>(experimental feature)</span> and currently we have validated that this process can significantly improve some popular transformer model’s inference speed. Currently this method is under development and only supports some particular structures. Please refer more details of such method in this <a class="reference external" href="../../examples/deprecated/pytorch/nlp/huggingface_models/question-answering/model_slim/">model slim example</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unstructured Pruning</p>
<p>Unstructured pruning means pruning parameters individually without any constraints.  <em>Users could set “1x1” in  pruning pattern to enable it.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

</a>
</div><ul>
<li><p>Multi-head Attention Pruning</p>
<p>Multi-head attention mechanism boosts transformer models’ capability of contextual information analysis. However, different heads’ contribution to the final output varies. In most situation, a number of heads can be removed without causing accuracy drop. Head pruning can be applied in a wide range of scenes including BERT, GPT as well as other large language models. <strong>We haven’t support it in pruning, but we have provided experimental feature in Model Auto Slim</strong>.

<section id="pruning-criteria">
<h3>Pruning Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#pruning-criteria" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Pruning Criteria determines how should the weights of a neural network are scored and pruned. In the image below, pruning score is represented by neurons’ color and those with the lowest scores are pruned. Currently, Intel Neural Compressor supports <strong>magnitude</strong>, <strong>gradient</strong>, <strong>snip</strong> and <strong>snip momentum(default)</strong> criteria; pruning criteria is defined along with pruning type of Intel Neural Compressor configurations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnitude</p>
<p>The algorithm prunes the weight by the lowest absolute value of each layer with given sparsity target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gradient</p>
<p>Gradient based criterion. The algorithm prunes the weight by the lowest gradient value of each layer with given sparsity target. Note that when using a gradient-based criterion, it is necessary to let the pruning start step &gt;= 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SNIP</p>
<p>Gradient based criterion. Please refer to the original <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02340">paper</a> for more details. $W$ and $G$ are model’s weights and gradients respectively.</p>
<p>$$Score = |W \times G|$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>SNIP Momentum</p>
<p>Gradient based criterion. The algorithm improves original SNIP algorithm and updates the score in a momentum way.<br />In the following formula, $n$ is the training step and $W$ and $G$ are model’s weights and gradients respectively.
$$Score_{n} = 1.0 \times Score_{n-1} + 0.9 \times |W_{n} \times G_{n}|$$</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="pruning-types">
<h3>Pruning Types<a class="headerlink" href="#pruning-types" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Pruning type defines how the masks are generated and applied to a neural network. In Intel Neural Compressor, both pruning criterion and pruning type are defined in pruning_type. Currently supported pruning types include <strong>snip_momentum(default)</strong>, <strong>snip_momentum_progressive</strong>, <strong>magnitude</strong>, <strong>magnitude_progressive</strong>, <strong>gradient</strong>, <strong>gradient_progressive</strong>, <strong>snip</strong>, <strong>snip_progressive</strong> and <strong>pattern_lock</strong>. progressive pruning is preferred when large patterns like 1xchannel and channelx1 are selected. Please note that progressive pruning only supports NxM patterns and is preferred when large patterns such as 1xchannel and channelx1 are selected.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Progressive Pruning</p>
<p>Progressive pruning aims at smoothing the structured pruning by automatically interpolating a group of intervals masks during the pruning process. In this method, a sequence of masks is generated to enable a more flexible pruning process and those masks would gradually change into ones to fit the target pruning structure.
Progressive pruning is used mainly for channel-wise pruning and currently only supports NxM pruning pattern.</p>
<div align = "center", style = "width: 77%; margin-bottom: 2%;">

    </a>
</div>
&emsp;&emsp;(a) refers to the traditional structured iterative pruning;  <Br/>
&emsp;&emsp;(b) inserts unstructured masks which prune some weights by referring to pruning criterion.<p>(b) is adopted in progressive pruning implementation. after a new structure pruning step, newly generated masks with full-zero blocks are not used to prune the model immediately. Instead, only a part of weights in these blocks is selected to be pruned by referring to these weights’ score maps. these partial-zero unstructured masks are added to the previous structured masks and  pruning continues. After training the model with these interpolating masks and masking more elements in these blocks, the mask interpolation process is returned. After several steps of mask interpolation, All weights in the blocks are finally masked and the model is trained as pure block-wise sparsity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pattern_lock Pruning</p>
<p>Pattern_lock pruning type uses masks of a fixed pattern during the pruning process. It locks the sparsity pattern in fine-tuning phase by freezing those zero values of weight tensor during weight update of training. It can be applied for the following scenario: after the model is pruned under a large dataset, pattern lock can be used to retrain the sparse model on a downstream task (a smaller dataset). Please refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05754.pdf">Prune once for all</a> for more information.</p>

<section id="pruning-schedules">
<h3>Pruning Schedules<a class="headerlink" href="#pruning-schedules" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Pruning schedule defines the way the model reaches the target sparsity (the ratio of pruned weights). Both  <strong>iterative</strong>  and <strong>one shot</strong> pruning schedules are supported.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Iterative Pruning</p>
<p>Iterative pruning means the model is gradually pruned to its target sparsity during a training process. The pruning process contains several pruning steps, and each step raises model’s sparsity to a higher value. In the final pruning step, the model reaches target sparsity and the pruning process ends.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One-shot Pruning</p>
<p>One-shot pruning means the model is pruned to its target sparsity with one single step. This often takes place at the initial stage of training/finetuning which simplifies the pruning procedure. However, one-shot pruning is prone to larger accuracy degradation compared to iterative pruning. <em>Users could set start_step=end_step in pruning configuration to enable this. Also please note if gradient based criterion is used, start step should be greater than 0.</em></p>

<h3>Pruning Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#pruning-scope" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Range of sparse score calculation in iterative pruning, default scope is global.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Global</p>
<p>The score map is computed out of entire parameters, Some layers are higher than the target sparsity and some of them are lower, the total sparsity of the model reaches the target. You can also set the “min sparsity ratio”/”max sparsity ratio” to be the same as the target to achieve same sparsity for each layer in a global way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Local</p>
<p>The score map is computed from the corresponding layer’s weight, The sparsity of each layer is equal to the target.</p>

<section id="regularization">
<h3>Regularization<a class="headerlink" href="#regularization" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Regularization is a technique that discourages learning a more complex model and therefore performs variable-selection. In the image below, some weights are pushed to be as small as possible and the connections are thus pruned. <strong>Group-lasso</strong> method is supported in Intel Neural Compressor.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Group Lasso</p>
<p>The main idea of Group Lasso is to construct an objective function that penalizes the L2 parameterization of the grouped variables, determines the coefficients of some groups of variables to be zero, and obtains a refined model by feature filtering.</p>

<h3>Large Language Model Pruning<a class="headerlink" href="#large-language-model-pruning" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>To efficiently achieve pruning for Large Language Models (LLMs), we have implemented two post-training pruning methods that utilize different pruning patterns: <strong>Retrain-free</strong> (channel-wise) and <strong>SparseGPT</strong> (1x1/N:M).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Retrain-free</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09656">The retrain-free algorithm</a> is a lightweight method that utilizes mask retrieval and rearrangement techniques within the Transformer architecture. By incorporating channel pruning and sparse model slimming for the linear layer in Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), it effectively achieves a 20% sparsity per layer while preserving accuracy with an accuracy loss of less than 1%. This algorithm seamlessly supports popular models like GPT, OPT, LLaMA, and BLOOM. Its capability to enhance model efficiency while maintaining performance makes it a valuable pruning approach for LLMs.</p>
<p>For a quick and efficient start with the retrain-free algorithm, please refer to the API instructions <a class="reference external" href="#Retrain-free-Pruning-API">Retrain-free Pruning API</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>SparseGPT</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00774">The SparseGPT algorithm</a> is an efficient post-training pruning method that operates on a block-wise basis. It supports multiple pruning patterns, including 1x1 and N:M, targeting the linear layers within the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) components. By applying this method, it is possible to achieve up to 50% sparsity on models with sizes larger than 10 billion parameters(More model parameters are less sensitive to sparsity), all while maintaining an accuracy loss of less than 1%. It is compatible with a wide range of models, including OPT, GPT, LLaMA, BLOOM, Dolly, MPT, Falcon, Stable-LM, and LaMini-LM, providing flexibility and effectiveness in pruning LLMs. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that larger model parameters tend to be less impacted by sparsity.</p>

<p>Particular hardware/software like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers">Intel Extension for Transformer</a> are required to obtain inference speed and footprints’ optimization for most sparse models. However, using model slim for some special structures can obtain significant inference speed improvements and footprint reduction without the post-pruning deployment. In other words, you can achieve model acceleration directly under your training framework (PyTorch, etc.)</p>
