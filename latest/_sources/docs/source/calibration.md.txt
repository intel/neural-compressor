## Introduction

Quantization proves beneficial in terms of reducing the memory and computational requirements of the model. Uniform quantization transforms the input value $x ∈ [β, α]$ to lie within $[−2^{b−1}, 2^{b−1} − 1]$, where $[β, α]$ is the range of real values chosen for quantization and $b$ is the bit-width of the signed integer representation. Calibration is the process of determining the $α$ and $β$ for model weights and activations. Refer to this [link](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/docs/source/quantization.html#quantization-fundamentals) for more quantization fundamentals

## Calibration Algorithms

Currently, Intel® Neural Compressor supports three popular calibration algorithms:

- MinMax: This method gets the maximum and minimum of input values as $α$ and $β$ [^1]. It preserves the entire range and is the simplest approach.

- Entropy: This method minimizes the KL divergence to reduce the information loss between full-precision and quantized data [^2]. Its primary focus is on preserving essential information.

- Percentile: This method only considers a specific percentage of values for calculating the range, ignoring the remainder which may contain outliers [^3]. It enhances resolution by excluding extreme values but still retaining noteworthy data.

The calibration algorithm is one of the tuning items utilized by Intel® Neural Compressor auto-tuning. The accuracy-aware tuning process will select an appropriate algorithm. Please refer to [tuning_strategies.html](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/docs/source/tuning_strategies.html#tuning-space) for more details.
