## Introduction

Intel速 Neural Compressor aims to help users quickly deploy
the low-precision inference solution on popular Deep Learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and ONNX. With built-in strategies, it automatically optimizes low-precision recipes for deep learning models to achieve optimal product objectives, such as inference performance and memory usage, with expected accuracy criteria. Currently, several tuning strategies, including `auto`, `O0`, `O1`, `Basic`, `MSE`, `MSE_V2`, `HAWQ_V2`, `Bayesian`, `Exhaustive`, `Random`, `SigOpt`, `TPE`, etc are supported. By default, the [`quant_level="auto"`](./tuning_strategies.md#auto) is used for tuning.

## Strategy Design
Before tuning, the `tuning space` was constructed according to the framework capability and user configuration. Then the selected strategy generates the next quantization configuration according to its traverse process and the previous tuning record. The tuning process stops when meeting the exit policy. The function of strategies is shown
below:

![Tuning Strategy](./imgs/strategy.png "Strategy Framework")

### Tuning Space

Intel速 Neural Compressor supports multiple quantization modes such as Post Training Static Quantization (PTQ static), Post Training Dynamic Quantization (PTQ dynamic), Quantization Aware Training, etc. One operator (OP) with a specific quantization mode has multiple ways to quantize, for example it may have multiple quantization scheme(symmetric/asymmetric), calibration algorithm(Min-Max/KL Divergence), etc. We use the [`framework capability`](./framework_yaml.md) to represent the methods that we have already supported. The `tuning space` includes all tuning items and their options. For example, the tuning items and options of the `Conv2D` (PyTorch) supported by Intel速 Neural Compressor are as follows:
![Conv2D_PyTorch_Cap](./imgs/Conv2D_PyTorch_Cap.png "Conv2D PyTorch Capability")

To incorporate the human experience and reduce the tuning time, user can reduce the tuning space by specifying the `op_name_dict` and `op_type_dict` in `PostTrainingQuantConfig` (`QuantizationAwareTrainingConfig`). Before tuning, the strategy will merge these configurations with framework capability to create the final tuning space.

> Note: Any options in the `op_name_dict` and `op_type_dict` that are not included in the [`framework capability`](./framework_yaml.md) will be ignored by the strategy.

### Exit Policy
User can control the tuning process by setting the exit policy by specifying the `timeout`, and `max_trials` fields in the `TuningCriterion`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import TuningCriterion

tuning_criterion = TuningCriterion(
    timeout=0,  # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). When set to 0, early stopping is enabled.
    max_trials=100,  # optional. max tuning times. combined with the `timeout` field to decide when to exit tuning.
    strategy="basic",  # optional. name of the tuning strategy.
    strategy_kwargs=None,  # optional. see concrete tuning strategy for available settings.
)
```


### Accuracy Criteria
User can set the accuracy criteria by specifying the `higher_is_better`, `criterion`, and `tolerable_loss` fields in the `AccuracyCriterion`.

``` python
from neural_compressor.config import AccuracyCriterion

accuracy_criterion = AccuracyCriterion(
    higher_is_better=True,  # optional.
    criterion="relative",  # optional. Available values are 'relative' and 'absolute'.
    tolerable_loss=0.01,  # optional.
)
```


### Tuning Process 

Intel速 Neural Compressor allows users to choose different tuning processes by specifying the quantization level (`quant_level`). Currently, the recognized `quant_level`s are `0`, `1`, and `"auto"`. For `quant_level` is `1`, the tuning process can be finer-grained controlled by setting the `strategy` field.

- `0`: "Conservative" tuning. `0` starts with an `fp32` model and tries to quantize OPs into lower precision by **op-type-wise**. `0` can be useful to give users insights about the accuracy degradation after quantizing some OPs.

- `1`: "Aggressive" tuning. `1` starts with the default quantization configuration and selects different quantization parameters. `1` can be used to achieve the performance. 

- `"auto"` (default) Auto tuning. `"auto"` combines the advantages of `quant_level=0` and `quant_level=1`. Currently, it tries default quantization configuration, `0`, and [`basic`](./tuning_strategies.md#basic) strategy sequentially.


## Tuning Algorithms


### Auto

#### Design

The auto tuning (`quant_level`=`"auto"`) is the default tuning process. Classical settings are shown below:

#### Usage

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level="auto",  # optional, the quantization level.
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        timeout=0,  # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). When set to 0, early stopping is enabled.
        max_trials=100,  # optional. max tuning times. combined with the `timeout` field to decide when to exit tuning.
    ),
)
```
### Conservative Tuning

#### Design
The conservative tuning (`quant_level`=`0`) starts with an `fp32` model and tries to convert key OPs like `conv`, `matmul`, or `linear` into lower precision **op-type-wise**.
#### Usage

To use conservative tuning, the `quant_level` field should be set to `0` in `PostTrainingQuantConfig`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=0,  # the quantization level.
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        timeout=0,  # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). When set to 0, early stopping is enabled.
        max_trials=100,  # optional. max tuning times. combined with the `timeout` field to decide when to exit tuning.
    ),
)
```

## Basic

### Design

The `Basic` strategy is designed for quantizing most models. There are several stages executed by `Basic` strategy sequentially, and the tuning process ends once the condition meets the exit policy.  The diagram below illustrates each stage, accompanied by additional details provided for each annotated step.

> `Opt` stands for optional which mean this stage can be skipped.

> `*` INC will detect the block pattern for [transformer-like](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model by default.

> For [smooth quantization](./smooth_quant.md), users can tune the smooth quantization alpha by providing a list of scalars for the `alpha` item. For details usage, please refer to the [smooth quantization example](./smooth_quant.md#Usage).

> For [weight-only quantization](./quantization_weight_only.md), users can tune the weight-only  algorithms from the available [pre-defined configurations](./quantization_weight_only.md#woq-algorithms-tuning). The tuning process will take place at the **start stage** of the tuning procedure, preceding the smooth quantization alpha tuning. For details usage, please refer to the [weight-only quantization example](./quantization_weight_only.md#woq-algorithms-tuning).
*Please note that this behavior is specific to the `ONNX Runtime` backend.*

**1.** Default quantization

At this stage, it attempts to quantize OPs with the default quantization configuration which is consistent with the framework's behavior.

**2.** Apply all recipes

At this stage, it tries to apply all recipes. This stage will be skipped if user assigned the usage of all recipes.

**3.** OP-Type-Wise Tuning

At this stage, it tries to quantize OPs as many as possible and traverse all OP type wise tuning configs. Note that, the OP is initialized with different quantization modes according to the quantization approach.

a. `post_training_static_quant`: Quantize all OPs support PTQ static.

b. `post_training_dynamic_quant`: Quantize all OPs support PTQ dynamic.

c. `post_training_auto_quant`: Quantize all OPs support PTQ static or PTQ dynamic. For OPs supporting both PTQ static and PTQ dynamic, PTQ static will be tried first, and PTQ dynamic will be tried when none of the OP type wise tuning configs meet the accuracy loss criteria.

**4.** Try recipe One by One

At this stage, it sequentially tries recipe based on the tuning config with the best result in the previous stage. This stage will be skipped the recipes(s) specified by user.

If the above trials not meet the accuracy requirements, it start to performs fallback, which mean converting quantized OP(s) into high-precision(FP32, BF16 ...).

**5.1** Block-wise fallback*

For the [transformer-like](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model, it will use the detected transformer block by default, and conduct the block-wise fallback. In each trial, all OPs within a block are reverted to high-precision.

**5.2** Instance-wise fallback

At this stage, it performs high-precision OP (FP32, BF16 ...) fallbacks one by one based on the tuning config with the best result in the previous stage, and records the impact of each OP. 

**5.3**  Accumulated fallback

At the final stage, it first sorted the OPs list according to the impact score in stage V, and tries to incrementally fallback multiple OPs to high precision according to the sorted OP list.


### Usage

`Basic` is the default strategy for `quant_level`=`1`, it can be used by default with nothing changed in the `strategy` field of `TuningCriterion` after set the `quant_level`=`1` in `PostTrainingQuantConfig`. Classical settings are shown below:

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(strategy="basic"),  # optional. name of tuning strategy.
)
```

### MSE

#### Design

`MSE` and `Basic` strategies share similar ideas. The primary difference
between the two strategies is the way sorted op lists generated in stage II. The `MSE` strategy needs to get the tensors for each OP of raw FP32
models and the quantized model based on the best model-wise tuning
configuration. It then calculates the MSE (Mean Squared Error) for each
OP, sorts those OPs according to the MSE value, and performs
the op-wise fallback in this order.

#### Usage

The usage of `MSE` is similar to `Basic`. To use `MSE` strategy, the `strategy` field of the `TuningCriterion` should be specified with `mse`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(strategy="mse"),
)
```

### MSE_V2

#### Design

`MSE_v2` is a strategy with a two stages fallback and revert fallback. In the fallback stage, it uses multi-batch data to score the op impact and then fallback the op with the highest score util found the quantized model meets accuracy criteria. In the revert fallback stage, it also scores the impact of fallback OPs in the previous stage and selects the op with the lowest score to revert the fallback until the quantized model not meets accuracy criteria.

#### Usage
To use the `MSE_V2` tuning strategy, the `strategy` field in the `TuningCriterion` should be specified with `mse_v2`. Also, the `confidence_batches` can be specified optionally inside the `strategy_kwargs` for the number of batches to score the op impact. Increasing `confidence_batches` will generally improve the accuracy of the scoring with more time spent in tuning process.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="mse_v2",
        strategy_kwargs={"confidence_batches": 2},  # optional. the number of batches to score the op impact.
    ),
)
```

### HAWQ_V2

#### Design
`HAWQ_V2` implements the [Hessian Aware trace-Weighted Quantization of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03852). We made a small change to it by using the hessian trace to score the op impact and then fallback the OPs according to the scoring result.

#### Usage
To use the `HAWQ_V2` tuning strategy, the `strategy` field in the `TuningCriterion` should be specified with `hawq_v2`, and the loss function for calculating the hessian trace of model should be provided. The loss function should be set in the field of `hawq_v2_loss` in the `strategy_kwargs`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion


def model_loss(output, target, criterion):
    return criterion(output, target)


conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="hawq_v2",
        strategy_kwargs={"hawq_v2_loss": model_loss},  # required. the loss function for calculating the hessian trace.
    ),
)
```

### Bayesian

#### Design

`Bayesian` optimization is a sequential design strategy for the global
optimization of black-box functions. This strategy comes from the [Bayesian
optimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) package and
changed it to a discrete version that complied with the strategy standard of
Intel速 Neural Compressor. It uses [Gaussian processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_Gaussian_process) to define
the prior/posterior distribution over the black-box function with the tuning
history and then finds the tuning configuration that maximizes the expected
improvement. For now, `Bayesian` just focus on op-wise quantization configs tuning 
without the fallback phase. In order to obtain a quantized model with good accuracy 
and better performance in a short time. We don't add datatype as a tuning 
parameter into `Bayesian`.

#### Usage

For the `Bayesian` strategy, it is recommended to set `timeout` or `max_trials` to a non-zero
value as shown in below example, because the param space for `bayesian` can be very small and the accuracy goal might not be reached, which can make the tuning end never. Additionally, if the log level is set to `debug` by `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG` in the environment variable, the message `[DEBUG] Tuning config was evaluated, skip!` will print endlessly. If the `timeout` is changed from 0 to an integer, `Bayesian` ends after the timeout is reached.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        timeout=0,  # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). When set to 0, early stopping is enabled.
        max_trials=100,  # optional. max tuning times. combined with the `timeout` field to decide when to exit tuning.
        strategy="bayesian",
    ),
)
```

### Exhaustive

#### Design

The `Exhaustive` strategy is used to sequentially traverse all possible tuning
configurations in a tuning space. From the perspective of the impact on
performance, we currently only traverse all possible quantization tuning
configs. Same reason as `Bayesian`, fallback datatypes are not included for now.

#### Usage

`Exhaustive` usage is similar to `basic`, with `exhaustive` specified to `strategy` field in the `TuningCriterion`.


```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="exhaustive",
    ),
)
```

### Random

#### Design

`Random` strategy is used to randomly choose tuning configurations from the
tuning space. As with the `Exhaustive` strategy, it also only considers quantization
tuning configs to generate a better-performance quantized model.

#### Usage

`Random` usage is similar to `basic`, with `random` specified to `strategy` field in the `TuningCriterion`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="random",
    ),
)
```


### SigOpt

#### Design

`SigOpt` strategy is to use [SigOpt Optimization Loop](https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/optimization) method to accelerate and visualize the traversal of the tuning configurations from the tuning space. The metrics add accuracy as a constraint and optimize for latency to improve performance. [SigOpt Projects](https://app.sigopt.com/) can show the result of each tuning experiment.

#### Usage

Compared to `Basic`, `sigopt_api_token` and `sigopt_project_id` are necessary for `SigOpt`.
For details, [how to use sigopt strategy in neural_compressor](./sigopt_strategy.md) is available.

Note that the `sigopt_api_token`, `sigopt_project_id`, and `sigopt_experiment_name` should be set inside the `strategy_kwargs`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="sigopt",
        strategy_kwargs={
            "sigopt_api_token": "YOUR-ACCOUNT-API-TOKEN",
            "sigopt_project_id": "PROJECT-ID",
            "sigopt_experiment_name": "nc-tune",
        },
    ),
)
```


### TPE

#### Design

`TPE` uses sequential model-based optimization methods (SMBOs). **Sequential** refers to running trials one after another and selecting a better
**hyperparameter** to evaluate based on previous trials. A hyperparameter is
a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins; it
controls the learning process. SMBO apples Bayesian reasoning in that it
updates a **surrogate** model that represents an **objective** function
(objective functions are more expensive to compute). Specifically, it finds
hyperparameters that perform best on the surrogate and then applies them to
the objective function. The process is repeated and the surrogate is updated
with incorporated new results until the timeout or max trials is reached.

A surrogate model and selection criteria can be built in a variety of ways.
`TPE` builds a surrogate model by applying Bayesian reasoning. The TPE
algorithm consists of the following steps:

- Define a domain of hyperparameter search space.
- Create an objective function that takes in hyperparameters and outputs a
score (e.g., loss, RMSE, cross-entropy) that we want to minimize.
- Collect a few observations (score) using a randomly selected set of
hyperparameters.
- Sort the collected observations by score and divide them into two groups
based on some quantile. The first group (x1) contains observations that
give the best scores and the second one (x2) contains all other
observations.
- Model the two densities l(x1) and g(x2) using Parzen Estimators (also known as kernel density estimators), which are a simple average of kernels centered on existing data points.
- Draw sample hyperparameters from l(x1). Evaluate them in terms of l(x1)/g(x2), and return the set that yields the minimum value under l(x1)/g(x1) that
corresponds to the greatest expected improvement. Evaluate these
hyperparameters on the objective function.
- Update the observation list in step 3.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 with a fixed number of trials.

>Note: TPE requires many iterations in order to reach an optimal solution.
It is recommended to run at least 200 iterations, because every iteration
requires evaluation of a generated model, which means accuracy measurements
on a dataset and latency measurements using a benchmark. This process may
take from 24 hours to a few days to complete, depending on the model.

#### Usage

`TPE` usage is similar to `basic` with `tpe` specified to `strategy` field in the `TuningCriterion`.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    quant_level=1,
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(strategy="tpe"),
)
```



The `next_tune_cfg` function is used to yield the next tune configuration according to some algorithm or strategy. `TuneStrategy` base class will traverse all the tuning space till a quantization configuration meets the pre-defined accuracy criterion.

The `traverse` function can be overridden optionally if the traverse process required by the new strategy is different from the one `TuneStrategy` base class implemented.

An example of customizing a new tuning strategy can be reached at [TPE Strategy](../../neural_compressor/contrib/strategy/tpe.py).

## Distributed Tuning

### Design

Intel速 Neural Compressor provides distributed tuning to speed up the tuning process by leveraging the multi-node cluster. It seamlessly parallelizes the tuning process across multi nodes by using the MPI. In distributed tuning, the `fp32` model is replicated on every node, and each original model replica is fed with a different quantization configuration. The master handler coordinates the tuning process and synchronizes the tuning result of each stage to every slave handler. The distributed tuning allows the tuning process to scale up significantly to the number of nodes, which translates into faster results and more efficient utilization of computing resources. 

The diagram below provides an overview of the distributed tuning process.
![distributed tuning](./imgs/distributed_tuning_intro.png "Distributed Tuning")


### Usage

To use Distributed Tuning, the number of processes should be specified to be greater than 1.

```shell
mpirun -np <number_of_processes> <RUN_CMD>
```
An example of distributed tuning can be reached at [ptq_static_mrpc](../../examples/pytorch/nlp/huggingface_models/text-classification/quantization/ptq_static/fx).


## Customize a New Tuning Strategy

Intel速 Neural Compressor supports new strategy extension by implementing a sub-class of the `TuneStrategy` class in neural_compressor.strategy package and registering it by the `strategy_registry` decorator.

For example, user can implement an `Abc` strategy like below:

```python
@strategy_registry
class AbcTuneStrategy(TuneStrategy):
    def __init__(self, model, conf, q_dataloader, q_func=None, eval_dataloader=None, eval_func=None, dicts=None): ...

    def next_tune_cfg(self):
        # generate the next tuning config
        ...

    def traverse(self):
        for tune_cfg in self.next_tune_cfg():
            # do quantization
            ...
```
