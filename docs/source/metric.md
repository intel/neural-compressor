## Introduction

In terms of evaluating the performance of a specific model, we should have general metrics to measure the performance of different models. Different frameworks always have their own Metric module but with different APIs and parameters. As for Intel® Neural Compressor, it implements an internal metric and provides a unified `Metric` API. In special cases, users can also register their own metric classes through [Build Custom Metric with Python API](#build-custom-metric-with-python-api).

## Supported Built-in Metric Matrix

Neural Compressor supports some built-in metrics that are popularly used in industry.

## Get Started with Metric

### Use Intel® Neural Compressor Metric API

Users can specify a Neural Compressor built-in metric such as shown below:

```python
from neural_compressor import Metric
from neural_compressor import quantization, PostTrainingQuantConfig

top1 = Metric(name="topk", k=1)
config = PostTrainingQuantConfig()
q_model = fit(model, config, calib_dataloader=calib_dataloader, eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader, eval_metric=top1)
```

### Build Custom Metric with Python API

Please refer to [Metrics code](../../neural_compressor/metric), users can also register their own metric as follows:

```python
class NewMetric(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # init code here

    def update(self, preds, labels):
        # add preds and labels to storage

    def reset(self):
        # clear preds and labels storage

    def result(self):
        # calculate metric result
        return result

```

The result() function returns a higher-is-better scalar to reflect model accuracy on an evaluation dataset.

After defining the metric class, users can initialize it and pass it to quantizer:

```python
from neural_compressor import quantization, PostTrainingQuantConfig

new_metric = NewMetric()
config = PostTrainingQuantConfig()
q_model = fit(model, config, calib_dataloader=calib_dataloader, eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader, eval_metric=new_metric)
```

## Example

- Refer to this [example](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples/onnxrt/body_analysis/onnx_model_zoo/arcface/quantization/ptq_static) for how to define a customised metric.

- Refer to this [example](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/efficientnet-b0/quantization/ptq) for how to use internal metric.
