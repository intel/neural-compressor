model:                                               # mandatory. lpot uses this model name and framework name to decide where to save tuning history and deploy yaml.
  name: wide_deep_large_ds
  framework: tensorflow                              # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.
  inputs: new_numeric_placeholder,new_categorical_placeholder
  outputs: import/head/predictions/probabilities     # optional. inputs and outputs fields are only required for tensorflow backend.

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 2000                              # optional. default value is the size of whole dataset. used to set how many portions of calibration dataset is used. exclusive with iterations field.
  model_wise:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
    activation:
      algorithm: minmax
  op_wise: {
             'import/dnn/hiddenlayer_0/MatMul': {
               'activation':  {'dtype': ['uint8'], 'algorithm': ['minmax'], 'scheme':['asym']},
             }
           }

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
    max_trials: 100                                  # optional. max tune times. default value is 100. combine with timeout field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
