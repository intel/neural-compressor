model:                                               # mandatory. lpot uses this model name and framework name to decide where to save tuning history and deploy yaml.
  name: style_transfer
  framework: tensorflow                              # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.
  inputs: style_input,content_input                  # optional. inputs and outputs fields are only required for tensorflow backend.
  outputs: transformer/expand/conv3/conv/Sigmoid

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.

tuning:

    max_trials: 100                                  # optional. max tune times. default value is 100. combine with timeout field to decide when to exit.
