"""Input pipeline for the transformer model to read, filter, and batch examples.

Two things to note in the pipeline:

1. Batching scheme

   The examples encoded in the TFRecord files contain data in the format:
     {"inputs": [variable length array of integers],
      "targets": [variable length array of integers]}
   Where integers in the arrays refer to tokens in the English and German vocab
   file (named `vocab.ende.32768`).

   Prior to batching, elements in the dataset are grouped by length (max between
   "inputs" and "targets" length). Each group is then batched such that:
     group_batch_size * length <= batch_size.

   Another way to view batch_size is the maximum number of tokens in each batch.

   Once batched, each element in the dataset will have the shape:
     {"inputs": [group_batch_size, padded_input_length],
      "targets": [group_batch_size, padded_target_length]}
   Lengths are padded to the longest "inputs" or "targets" sequence in the batch
   (padded_input_length and padded_target_length can be different).

   This batching scheme decreases the fraction of padding tokens per training
   batch, thus improving the training speed significantly.

2. Shuffling

   While training, the dataset is shuffled in two places in the code. The first
   is the list of training files. Second, while reading records using
   `parallel_interleave`, the `sloppy` argument is used to generate randomness
   in the order of the examples.
