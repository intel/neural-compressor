model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: mobilenet_v1 
  framework: tensorflow                              # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integer, onnxrt_qlinear or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.
  inputs: image_tensor
  outputs: detection_boxes, detection_scores, detection_classes, num_detections

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 20                                # optional. default value is 100. used to set how many samples should be used in calibration.
 
evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in lpot.Quantization.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in lpot.Quantization.
    metric:
      topk: 1                                        # built-in metrics are topk, map, f1, allow user to register new metric.
