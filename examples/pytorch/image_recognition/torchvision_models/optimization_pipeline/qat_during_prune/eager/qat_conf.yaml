model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: imagenet_qat
  framework: pytorch                                 # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integer, onnxrt_qlinear or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.

quantization:                                        # optional. required for QAT and PTQ.
  approach: quant_aware_training                     # mandatory. supported values are quant_aware_training and post_training_static_quant.

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.

  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
