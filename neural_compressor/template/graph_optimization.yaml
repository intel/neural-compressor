tuning:

  objective: performance                             # optional. objective with accuracy constraint guaranteed. default value is performance. other values are modelsize and footprint.

    performance_only: False                          # optional. max tune times. default value is False which means only generate fully quantized model.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
  tensorboard: True                                  # optional. dump tensor distribution in evaluation phase for debug purpose. default value is False.

  workspace:
    path: /path/to/saving/directory                  # optional. default workspace is ./nc_workspace/current_time_stamp, saving tuning history and deploy yaml.
    resume: /path/to/a/specified/snapshot/file       # optional. if specified, resume from tuning history.
