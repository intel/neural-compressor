   env.run_migrations_online



.. py:function:: run_migrations_offline()

   Run migrations in 'offline' mode.

   This configures the context with just a URL
   and not an Engine, though an Engine is acceptable
   here as well.  By skipping the Engine creation
   we don't even need a DBAPI to be available.

   Calls to context.execute() here emit the given string to the
   script output.



.. py:function:: run_migrations_online()

   Run migrations in 'online' mode.

   In this scenario we need to create an Engine
   and associate a connection with the context.
