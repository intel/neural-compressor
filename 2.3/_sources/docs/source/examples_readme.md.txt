## Example List
A wide variety of examples are provided to demonstrate the usage of Intel® Neural Compressor in different frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and ONNX Runtime.
View the [examples in Neural Compressor GitHub Repo](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples).

## Release Data
Intel® Neural Compressor validated the quantization for 10K+ models from popular model hubs (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers, Torchvision, TensorFlow Model Hub, ONNX Model Zoo) with the performance speedup up to 4.2x on VNNI while minimizing the accuracy loss. Over 30 pruning and knowledge distillation samples are also available.
Release data for validated typical models are available [here](/docs/source/validated_model_list.html).
